A simple website that uses Javascript to detect Keyboard input and plays sound corresponding to the elements of a drum kit

Project 1 - Drum Kit
	• KeyCode.info website to get keyboard key to number translation
	• Data attributes not standard.
		○ Data-key is used to hook up elements with a certain key value
	• Listening for Events
		○ You have tag the listening phenomena to a particular element that you will be listening for:
			§ Window
			§ Input
			§ Div
		○ On the element of choice you need to evoke the 'addEventListener' method
			§ For example if I decide to listen on Window
				□ window.addEventListener(…..)
			§ For example if I decide to listen on Input
				□ Input.addEventListener(…..)
		○ Understanding the addEventListener method in more details
			§ This method takes some important arguments
				□ Argument 1 is the event:
					® 'keydown' - this is looking for Keyboard keys to be pressed DOWN
				□ Argument 2 is the function that will run when argument 1 happens
					® the function will create the event
					® The function takes in 1 input argument, lets call it 'e', and this 'e' is basically related to and generated based on the main event Argument 1 (in this case lets say 'keydown')
	• The Document.querySelector method of the document class
		○ You use this object/method to look up specific elements that have been defined in your HTML code (like div or img or p)
			§ Now to add more specificity there is also syntax/ways to address specific elements or groups of elements
			§ For example:
				□ Const audio = document.querySelector('audio[data-key="65"]');
					® This is looking a specific audio element which has a data-key attribute defined to it with a value of "65"
					® <audio data-key="65">
	• We first select all key elements that are displayed on the screen using document.querySelectorAll
		○ Use 'ALL' for multiple elements
	• Then for each return element we should add an event listener which will check if either of those element key values have completed the animation effect on their respective span blocks
So you are listening for the TransitionEnd event
